    <h2 align="center"><i>A look at the relationship between the famous physicist Stephen Hawking and his wife.</i></h2>
    
    <h4 align="center">
        'The Theory of Everything is the story of the most brilliant and celebrated physicist of our time, Stephen Hawking, 
        and Jane Wilde, the arts student he fell in love with while studying at Cambridge in the 1960s. Little was expected 
        from Hawking, a bright but shiftless student of cosmology, after he was given just two years to live following the 
        diagnosis of a fatal illness (ALS) at 21 years of age. He became galvanized, however, by the love Jane Wilde, and went
         on to be called the "successor to Einstein," as well as a husband and father to their three children. Over the course 
         of their marriage, however, as Stephen's body collapsed and his academic renown soared, fault lines were exposed that 
         tested the resolve of their relationship and dramatically altered the course of both of their lives.
