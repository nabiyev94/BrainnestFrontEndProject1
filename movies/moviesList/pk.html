    <h3 align="center">
        An alien on Earth loses the only device he can use to communicate with his spaceship. 
        His innocent nature and child-like questions force the country to evaluate the impact of religion on its people.

    <h4 align="center">
        P. K. is a comedy of ideas about a stranger in the city, who asks questions that no one has asked before. 
        They are innocent, child-like questions, but they bring about catastrophic answers. People who are set in their 
        ways for generations, are forced to reappraise their world when they see it from PK's innocent eyes. In the process 
        PK makes loyal friends and powerful foes. Mends broken lives and angers the establishment. P. K.'s childlike curiosity
         transforms into a spiritual odyssey for him and millions of others. The film is an ambitious and uniquely original 
         exploration of complex philosophies. It is also a simple and humane tale of love, laughter and letting-go. Finally, 
         it is a moving saga about a friendship between strangers from worlds apart.
