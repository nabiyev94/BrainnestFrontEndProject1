    <h2 align="center">Description</h2>
    <h3 align="center">Two friends are searching for their long lost companion. They revisit their college days and recall the 
        memories of their friend who inspired them to think differently, even as the rest of the world called them "idiots".
    </h3>
    
    <h4 align="center">
        Farhan Qureshi and Raju Rastogi want to re-unite with their fellow collegian, Rancho, after faking a stroke aboard an Air India
        plane, and excusing himself from his wife - trouser less - respectively. Enroute, they encounter another student, Chatur
        Ramalingam, now a successful businessman, who reminds them of a bet they had undertaken 10 years ago. The trio, while 
        recollecting hilarious antics, including their run-ins with the Dean of Delhi's Imperial College of Engineering, Viru 
        Sahastrabudhe, race to locate Rancho, at his last known address - little knowing the secret that was kept from them all 
        this time.
