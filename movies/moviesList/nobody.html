    <h2 align="center">Description</h2>
    <h3 align="center">A boy stands on a station platform as a train is about to leave. 
        Should he go with his mother or stay with his father? Infinite possibilities arise from this decision. 
        As long as he doesn't choose, anything is possible.</h3>
    
    <h4 align="center">
        'Nemo Nobody' is recounting his life story to a reporter. He's less than clear, often times thinking that
         he is 34 years of age, others, well over 100. But his story becomes more confusing after he does focus on 
         the fact of his current real age.
